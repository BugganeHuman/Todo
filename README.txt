1: This is a minimalistic ToDo site.
   With functions for adding and deleting tasks. There is a separate "work" button that leads to the same todo in terms of functionality but a slightly different design
   (this is done to separate work tasks and just everyday ones), there is a "completed tasks" button that leads to a window with all deleted tasks
   (from the main todo and "work"), there is a "readme" button that leads to the text with a description of the project and a link to the repository.

2: Uses localStorage to remember tasks

3: Clone the repository with command:
   git clone https://github.com/BugganeHuman/todo.git
   Open the project
   No special installation is required, since this is a pure HTML/CSS/JS project.
   Open the index.html file in your browser (double-click it or open via a browser’s “Open File” option).
   Or, use Live Server in VS Code for automatic reloads while editing.
   And maybe if you want: 
   Optional: deploy
   You can deploy it easily on GitHub Pages:
   Push the repository to your GitHub account.
   Go to Settings → Pages → Source → main branch.
   Open the URL provided by GitHub Pages. 
4: link to site:
